Blood Group Prediction Model Using Fingerprint Data
This repository provides a Python-based solution for predicting blood groups using fingerprint data. The project leverages machine learning techniques and is compatible with PyCharm (for .py files) and Google Colab (for .ipynb files).

How to Use
1. Download the Code Files
For PyCharm: Download the .py file from the repository.
For Google Colab: Download the .ipynb file from the repository.
2. Download the Dataset
Download the dataset required for training the model from the Dataset folder in the repository or the link provided.
3. Train the Model
Run the first half of the code to preprocess the dataset and train the model for blood group prediction. This step generates a .h5 file containing the trained model.
4. Edit the Model Path
In the second half of the code, update the path to the .h5 file generated during training. This step is required to load the model for predictions.
5. Test with Different Fingerprints
Add various fingerprint samples to the dataset and evaluate how accurately the model predicts the blood group.
